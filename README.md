# am2pb - Alertmanager to Pushbullet

A simple service that listens for alerts from Alertmanager via the [webhook receiver](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/#webhook_config),
and forwards them to [Pushbullet](http://pushbullet.com/).

This project was created to help me learn Go, do not use in production.
